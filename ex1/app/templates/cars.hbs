<h2>Question 1</h2>

<p>You are building an Ember.js application where you need to create a blueprint for Car objects. 
    Each Car should have brand, model, and year as properties. Create an instance of a Car with the brand "Toyota",
    model "Camry", and year 2024. Additionally, add a method getCarDetails that returns a formatted string like: 
    "Toyota Camry (2024)".</p>

<h3>Output is in console</h3>
